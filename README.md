# CircuitPython stuffs
some small circuitpython programs that I made for school.

README is a text file describing all the stuff I have made so far.

RGB is a library for using RGBLEDs.

button_count_LCD counts up or down when a button is pressed depending on wether a switch has been flipped and prints teh value to an LCD.

capacitive_touch_servo moves a servo one way when you touch one wire and the other way when you touch the other.

color_scale_distance_thing fades the onboard neopixel through the color scale depending on the input from the distance sensor.

fading_led is a single color LED that fades in and out as time progresses.

photointerrupter_LCD_thing counts the number of times a photointerrupter has been interrupted and displays the number to an LCD every 4 seconds.

rAiNbOwS was created to be used by the RGB library and makes two RGBLEDs do rainbow things.

complicated_wiring is the thing I used to test FancyLED

FancyLED is another library, this time for 3 seperate single color LEDs.
