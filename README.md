# CircuitPython stuffs
some small circuitpython programs that I made for school.

README is a text file describing all the stuff I have made so far.

RGB is a library for using RGBLEDs. it lets you set them to any of the 6 main colors, white, and off. the lesson i learned whiel making it was that the pin must be set to high to trun that specific color off. hooray for logic.

button_count_LCD counts up or down when a button is pressed depending on wether a switch has been flipped and prints the value to an LCD. i don't remember any lessons i learned with this one but there was probably something.

capacitive_touch_servo moves a servo one way when you touch one wire and the other way when you touch the other. the lesson i learned here was how to use capacitive touch.

color_scale_distance_thing fades the onboard neopixel through the color scale depending on the input from the distance sensor. the lesson in this one was 

fading_led is a single color LED that fades in and out as time progresses.

photointerrupter_LCD_thing counts the number of times a photointerrupter has been interrupted and displays the number to an LCD every 4 seconds.

rAiNbOwS was created to be used by the RGB library and makes two RGBLEDs do rainbow things.

complicated_wiring is the thing I used to test FancyLED

FancyLED is another library, this time for 3 seperate single color LEDs.
